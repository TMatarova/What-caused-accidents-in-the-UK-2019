Exploring police record accident data in 2019 

The data was taken from https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-accidents-safety-data but was cleaned using Python to build the dataset used in the dashboards.

There are two dashboards (PowerBI and Tableau) which explore accidents in the UK in 2019.

The goal of these dashboards is to explore what possible policies and safety measures could be suggested to improve road safety.
There are 4 questions presented which are answered through using the dashboards:

Q1) What vehicle type was involved in the most casualties?
Q2) Does reducing the speed limit reduce accident severity?
Q3) Which age group was involved in the most accidents throughout the year, proportionally?
Q4) Where do accidents involving 8+ vehicles on single carriageways, at speed limits with the highest proportion of fatal accidents, cause the most casualties?

These questions being answered helps to explore the potential specific policies that can be put in place.

To explore these dashboards PowerBI and Tableua are required and the dataset in this repo must be downloaded.
